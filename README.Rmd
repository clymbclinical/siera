## Overview

With siera, users ingest Analysis Results Standard (ARS) metadata and auto-generate R scripts that, when
run with provided ADaM datasets, provide Analysis Results Datasets
(ARDs).

## Installation

The current version of siera can be installed from 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=siera) with:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

```{r install, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("siera")
```
## Requirements

The main functions within siera is the readARS() (for JSON ARS input) and readARS_xl (for Excel ARS input) functions.  These functions ingests ARS metadata, and provide R scripts (producing ARDs).  In order to make use of these functions, the following are required:

1.  A functional ARS file, representing ARS Metadata for a Reporting Event
2.  An output directory where the R scripts will be placed
3.  A folder containing the related ADaM datasets for the ARDs to be generated

## Example to get started using JSON ARS file

```{r library, warning=FALSE}
library(siera)
```

siera includes several example files, which we use throughout the documentation.  These include a JSON ARS file, as well as some csv ADaMs (ADSL and ADAE) which can be run with the R scripts produced by readARS function. Use the helper ARS_example() with no arguments to list them or call it with an example filename to get the path.

```{r example files}
# To see a list of example files:
ARS_example()

# A temporary path to a specific file:
ARS_example("ARS_V1_Common_Safety_Displays.json")
```
Next, we will ingest the example json ARS file to meta-programme ready-to-run R scripts, 
which will produce the ARDs. 
```{r example, message=FALSE}
# Path to the the ARS JSON File. 
json_path <- ARS_example("ARS_V1_Common_Safety_Displays.json")

# Path to a folder which will contain the meta-programmed R scripts (feel free to update 
# to a more suitable path)
output_folder <- tempdir()

# this folder contains ADaM datasets to produce ARD (we will use temporary 
# directory tempdir(), but feel free to download the ADaMs required and use the location they are stored in.
# This can be done with e.g. dirname(ARS_example("ADSL.csv"))
ADaM_folder <- tempdir()

# run the readARS function with these 3 parameters.  This creates R scripts (1 for each output in output_folder)
readARS(json_path, output_folder, ADaM_folder)
```

Once the R programs are created, they can be individually run, provided that the ADaM datasets are in the location as provided to the readARS function.
